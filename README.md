## Overview

The **AI Deception Framework** is a research tool designed to explore the potential for deception in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It provides mechanisms to study, detect, and mitigate deceptive behaviors in AI models. The framework is useful for researchers, developers, and ethicists interested in understanding how AI could deceive humans or other systems, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

## Features

- **Deception Detection**: Algorithms to identify potential deceptive patterns in AI-generated outputs.
- **Scenario Simulation**: Tools to simulate environments and observe AI behaviors under different controlled scenarios.
- **Ethical Analysis**: Evaluate the ethical implications of AI decisions and behaviors.
- **Transparency Metrics**: Measure the transparency of AI decision-making and outputs.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop and test methods to reduce deceptive behaviors in AI systems.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

	•	Python 3.7 or higher
	•	Pip package manager

Setup Instructions

	1.	Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Exios66/Ai-Deception-Framework.git
cd Ai-Deception-Framework

	2.	Install the required dependencies:
 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt



Running the Application

The application is built using Flask. You can run it locally as follows:

	1.	Make the run script executable (if using a run script):

chmod +x run.sh


	2.	Start the Flask server:

./run.sh

Alternatively, you can run the app manually with Python:

python app.py


	3.	Access the application at https://localhost:8000. Accept the self-signed certificate if prompted.

API Documentation

The framework includes an API for interacting with local files, such as parsing and fetching questions. You can use the OpenAPI specification (openapi.yaml) to explore available endpoints.

Example API Request

To fetch and parse questions from a local file, send a GET request to /fetch-local-questions:

curl "https://localhost:8000/fetch-local-questions?file_path=/path/to/your/file.db"

OpenAPI Specification

The API follows the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification, with a development server defined at https://localhost:8000. You can view the API documentation by loading the openapi.yaml file into any OpenAPI-compatible tool such as Swagger UI.

Usage

This framework can be used in various contexts, including:

	•	Research: Studying how AI systems might engage in deceptive behaviors.
	•	Testing: Running simulations to observe how an AI reacts in controlled deception scenarios.
	•	Ethical Analysis: Measuring the transparency and ethicality of AI decision-making processes.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

	1.	Fork the repository.
	2.	Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
	3.	Make your changes and commit them (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
	4.	Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
	5.	Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to the existing coding style and passes any tests.

Future Plans

	•	Extend the deception detection algorithms.
	•	Improve simulation tools with more diverse and complex scenarios.
	•	Incorporate machine learning techniques for better detection and mitigation of deceptive behavior.
