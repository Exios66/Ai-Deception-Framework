Section 1: Demographics and General Technology Use

This section helps to contextualize the responses and can control for confounding variables.

	1.	Age (Open-ended or multiple choice ranges)
	2.	Gender (Optional: Male/Female/Non-binary/Prefer not to say)
	3.	Highest level of education (Multiple choice: High school, Bachelor’s, Master’s, Doctorate, etc.)
	4.	Occupation (Open-ended)

Section 2: General AI Experience

The goal is to understand the participant’s general exposure to and familiarity with AI technologies.

	1.	How familiar are you with Artificial Intelligence tools?
(Likert scale: 1 = Not familiar at all, 5 = Extremely familiar)
	2.	Which of the following AI-based tools have you used? (Check all that apply)
	•	AI-powered virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
	•	Image generation tools (e.g., MidJourney, DALL·E)
	•	Large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard)
	•	AI-powered recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix recommendations, Spotify suggestions)
	•	None
	3.	How often do you use AI-based tools in your daily life?
(Multiple choice: Never, Less than once a week, 1-3 times a week, Almost every day, Daily)

Section 3: Specific Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This section narrows the focus to LLMs, like ChatGPT, to gauge experience.

	1.	Have you ever used a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT, GPT-3/4, or Bard?
(Yes/No)
	•	If Yes, how often do you use LLMs?
(Multiple choice: Less than once a month, 1-3 times a month, Weekly, Daily)
	2.	For what purposes have you used LLMs? (Check all that apply)
	•	Generating content (e.g., writing, creative tasks)
	•	Learning or understanding concepts
	•	Code generation or debugging
	•	Personal assistance (e.g., scheduling, answering general questions)
	•	Entertainment
	•	Other (Open-ended)
	3.	How would you rate your familiarity with the underlying technology of LLMs (e.g., understanding how they work)?
(Likert scale: 1 = No knowledge, 5 = Very knowledgeable)

Section 4: Perception of Reliability and Trust in LLMs

These questions aim to assess the participants’ trust and confidence in determining the reliability of information provided by LLMs.

	1.	How often do you fact-check information generated by LLMs?
(Multiple choice: Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
	2.	In your opinion, how reliable do you think the information provided by LLMs is?
(Likert scale: 1 = Not reliable at all, 5 = Extremely reliable)
	3.	How confident are you in your ability to discern between accurate and inaccurate information generated by LLMs?
(Likert scale: 1 = Not confident at all, 5 = Extremely confident)
	4.	Have you encountered incorrect or misleading information from LLMs in the past?
(Yes/No)
	•	If Yes, how often do you encounter such errors?
(Multiple choice: Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
	5.	When presented with information from LLMs, how do you usually verify its accuracy? (Check all that apply)
	•	I check multiple sources.
	•	I trust the information without verifying it.
	•	I use my own knowledge or expertise.
	•	I ask others to verify.
	•	Other (Open-ended)

Section 5: Self-Assessment of Prior Experience Level

This section helps you classify participants into experience groups based on their self-reported engagement.

	1.	How would you rate your overall experience with AI tools (including LLMs)?
(Likert scale: 1 = Low experience, 5 = High experience)
	2.	In comparison to others, how experienced do you feel in using AI technologies?
(Likert scale: 1 = Much less experienced, 5 = Much more experienced)

Section 6: Group Classification (Automatically Calculated)

At the end of the survey, you’ll assign participants to a group based on their responses:

	•	Low Experience:
	•	Rarely uses AI tools or LLMs.
	•	Low familiarity and confidence in understanding or discerning the accuracy of information from LLMs.
	•	Medium Prior Experience:
	•	Uses AI tools or LLMs occasionally.
	•	Moderate familiarity with LLM technology and some confidence in assessing information accuracy.
	•	High Prior Experience:
	•	Frequently uses AI tools and LLMs.
	•	High familiarity with LLMs and strong confidence in discerning reliability.

Example Grouping Logic:

	•	Low Experience: Scores 1-2 on Likert scales related to usage, confidence, and knowledge of LLMs.
	•	Medium Experience: Scores 3 on these scales.
	•	High Experience: Scores 4-5 on these scales.
