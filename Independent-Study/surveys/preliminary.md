Scoring Rubric for Experience Groups

We can classify participants into Low Experience, Medium Experience, or High Experience based on their total score across relevant sections. Here’s a breakdown of how the scores will be used for classification:

	•	Low Experience:
	•	Total score between 0 and 20 points
	•	Rare usage of LLMs, low familiarity with the technology, and low confidence in discerning fact from fiction.
	•	Medium Experience:
	•	Total score between 21 and 35 points
	•	Moderate usage of LLMs, some familiarity with the technology, and average confidence in discerning reliable information.
	•	High Experience:
	•	Total score between 36 and 55 points
	•	Frequent usage of LLMs, high familiarity with their workings, and strong confidence in evaluating the accuracy of the information.

Breakdown of Point Allocation:

	•	General AI Experience: 13 points maximum
	•	LLM-Specific Experience: 15 points maximum
	•	Perception of Reliability: 19 points maximum
	•	Self-Assessment: 10 points maximum
	•	Probability of Reliability: 10 points maximum

Total possible score: 67 points
